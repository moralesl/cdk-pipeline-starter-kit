# {{project_name}}

Built with the [Starter kit for CDK pipelines](https://github.com/moralesl/cdk-pipeline-starter-kit).

## Prerequisites
To have AWS CodePipeline read from this GitHub repo, you also need to have a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) stored as a plaintext secret (not a JSON secret) in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) under the name github-token. For instructions, see [Tutorial: Creating and Retrieving a Secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/tutorials_basic.html). The token should have the scopes `repo` and `admin:repo_hook`.

Add your details in the `infrastructure/config.ts` file.

## Project structure
